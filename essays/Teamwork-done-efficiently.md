<h3>Another Computer Science Course</h3>
Fall 2019, I took the course ICS 314 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. It was just another computer science course, which was going to teach software engineering in a web development environment. So once again I was able to gain a better understanding of the black screen with lots of different characters(coding). What I didn’t expect and which I will tell you more about, was the knowledge I gained about Agile Project Management. It’s definitely the skill I’m most proud to put on my professional portfolio, because I now know a way to organize and work with other people - which I believe is the key to any collaboration.


<h3>Agile Project Management</h3>

There are different ways to manage and organize projects, where one of them is called Agile Project Management. It’s commonly used in today’s society, and are making the projects being completed in small sections called iterations (Rouse, 2018). The result of each iteration determines what the upcoming will contain. This enables the team to handle issues as they come up throughout the project (Rouse, 2018). 

<h3>Issue Driven Project Management</h3>

Issue Driven Project Management is a way of performing Agile Project Management. In our case, we created a GitHub project board where we used a template to make the issue driven project board. We had three columns: to do, in progress and done. Each member of the group where assigned two issues for each milestone. If there were unfinished issues at the end of the milestone, we moved them over to the next one. The perks of this way of working was that everyone was assigned a responsibility for a piece of the site. It helped us organize ourselves, and also pushed people to work on the issues they were assigned. The fact that we at all times could see what our other group members where working on, enabled us to easily help each other out. I believe it was a fair, honest and effective way of collaborating.

<h3>Hello future colleagues- I look forward to working with you.</h3>
Even though my future Project teams might not be using Issue Driven Project Management the way we did, it’s a high risk that they will be using something similar. The fact that I have already experienced a project using Agile Project Management will prepare me for what’s coming. I’m happy with the way it worked out this time, with responsibility divided, the overview of all tasks and the flexibility it allows. So hello future colleagues - I look forward to working with you.
