<h3> Hello ESLint </h3>
Growing up I never had a big brother. No one to remind me to buy a present for mothers day, no one to give me inside information on how to handle first day of school, and basically no one to give me tips on how to live life in the best and most practical. Coding standards are actually a bit like big brothers, because they guide you on how to develop code in the “best” and most practical way. And even though I’ve done a couple programming classes earlier, this is my first meeting with coding standards. So, hello my new big coding brother I’m looking forward to get to know you.
For my studies I had considered law, psychology or economics. Mainly because my goal was to work with helping people, and at that point I didn’t believe computer science had anything to do with that. As my big sister is a computer engineer she introduced me to User Experience Design, and convinced me that it was worth a shot. I don’t know if it was my 3 months trip to Asia that confused me and made me trust her, or if my sister just is a really good seller.

ESLint with Intellij is the coding standard we are required to use in the course ICS 314. Only by attending class and doing collaborative programming tasks, I experienced for real how different all of us are. One day my partner wants to write the code in a specific way, the next class my new partner doesn't have an opinion, and so it keeps on going. And now I can finally turn to my big coding brother and ask, what should I do?

Another pro about ESLint with Intellij is the fact that you can see a green checkmark if everything is working correctly, and , when you get the green check mark. And if I’ve done something wrong, ESLint serves me a logic error message. That’s worth an applaus. 

By having defined one standard on how to develop your code, you also reduce the chances of getting mysterious errors at all.
