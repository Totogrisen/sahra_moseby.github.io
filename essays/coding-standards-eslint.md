<h3> Hello ESLint </h3>
Growing up I never had a big brother. No one to remind me to buy a present for mothers day, no one to give me inside information on how to handle first day of school, and basically no one to give me tips on how to live life in the best and most practical. Coding standards are actually a bit like big brothers, because they guide you on how to develop code in the “best” and most practical way. And even though I’ve done a couple programming classes earlier, this is my first meeting with coding standards. So, hello my new big coding brother I’m looking forward to get to know you.

<h3>My What should i do? </h3>

ESLint with Intellij is the coding standard we are required to use in the course ICS 314. Only by attending class and doing collaborative programming tasks, I experienced for real how different all of us are. One day my partner wants to write the code in a specific way, the next class my new partner doesn't have an opinion, and so it keeps on going. But now everyone can finally ask our big brother, what should we do?

<h3>The hunt for a green checkmark</h3>

Another good thing about ESLint combined with Intellij is the fact that you can see a green checkmark if everything is working correctly. And if I’ve done something wrong, ESLint serves me a logic error message and sometimes even a suggestion for how fixing the error. That’s worth an applause. 

By having defined one standard on how to develop your code, you also reduce the chances of undetected errors, and you make sure that a collaboration with others produces the same format of code. In the beginning a coding standard may seem like a hassle, but if your just being a bit humble, it will benefit you. So I will stay strong and look for the green checkmark.
