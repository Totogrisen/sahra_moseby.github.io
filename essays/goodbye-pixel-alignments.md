<h3>It must be responsive</h3>
Considering my major being User Experience design, I´m often in a position where the front-end part of a web page ends up being my responsibility. And I’m glad to help, because I actually like making things look pretty in addition to maximise the user experience. In the beginning it’s nice figuring out the css, but then you realise it exists more than one device that are going to open the interface. UGH!


<h3>The pixel struggles</h3>

I always tell myself: don’t begin fooling around with the pixel alignments. But after a couple hours trying to make the interface work on my cell phone, the tablet, my friends even bigger phone etc… I find myself adjusting the top margin just a little bit one place, and the padding another place, and so it keeps going on, and BOOM the code is horrible and the interface looks horrible. And yes I know it exists tools like “Media Queries” and “Flexbox” that reduces the need of pixel adjustments. But sadly due to my own experience, it doesn't always work out so great anyways. Sadly, I often spend too much time on the responsive adjustment, instead of improving the user experience design.

<h3>Semantic UI, I love you</h3>

The framework Semantic UI was a new experience to me. I must say even though the endlessly amount of intro videos kind of killed me, I’m really happy about it. I do my normal htm and css stuff, splash some UI semantic on top of it, and suddenly I’m a visual designer as well. That’s something to add to my linkedin profile. In my opinion, the best part is that UI semantic makes producing responsive interfaces way to easy. Goodbye pixel adjustments!!

<h3>Well semantic UI - you're not all perfect</h3>
To be fear semantic UI isn't all rainbows and unicorns. Yes, my pixel adjustment frustration is gone, but there is a new one in town: the mystery of where I didn’t close my div. First of all my html looks like it’s being spammed by div elements. Secondly and the worst part in my opinion is that if you copy paste something, or removes a piece of code, you may spend some time hunting down the div your missing. The only way to find it is basically read your entire code. It’s all about where the div opens, and closes. But I would take the div hunt, rather than dealing with the pixel adjustments any day.
