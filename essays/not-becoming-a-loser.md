You can basically compare what the Bible is for the Christians, as what Stack Overflow is to developers. It helps programmers all over the world with their struggles, answering their questions, helping them figure out what is right and what is wrong, and tries to point them in the right direction (in life). 

At Stack Overflow you have angels, or so-called “hackers”, that tends to help people with their problems related to development by answering any questions they must have. Until now, Stack Overflow seems like a very welcoming and nice place to be - but that’s not necessarily true. Because it all really depends on how you use it, and most importantly: how you ask your questions. By asking a bad question, you will be considered a loser, and you will most likely not get an answer for your problem. This essay will give you some tips on how to avoid becoming a loser at Stack Overflow, based on guidelines defined by Eric Raymond. 

To illustrate what you’re supposed to do and avoid, am I presenting an example of a good and a bad question asked at Stack Overflow. 

<h3> The good</h3>

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/477816/what-is-the-correct-json-content-type">Link to the question</a>
 
This question is good because it’s both explicit and shows that he has searched for answers elsewhere already. One essential thing about this question is how the goal and the problem are clearly defined, which is important for avoiding open-ended questions and so-called “time-sinks”. After pointing out what he found on other pages, he even links to a similar question at Stack Overflow, describing how the answer was too vague for his purpose. By pointing that out, the hacker knows what didn´t work and also indicates a person that are willing to put some effort in getting his answer. That’s like both 10 points and a loser shield. 
 
 
 
<h3> The bad</h3>

">Link to the question</a>


In Eric Raymond’s guideline for asking smart questions, he specify how posting your non-working isn´t good enough, it will have you ignored, and you will become one of the losers. In this case the lost soul has included an error, which gave her one answer and five down votes, so I guess that’s something? This question also fails by making the header unattractive, by writing “What’s wrong with my code, please help me”. That doesn’t say anything specific about the problem, and as this example shows, it only got one answer.

<h3> Summary</h3>
To sum it up, four tips for being a smart asker: be explicit, come prepared, don’t post broken code without good hints, and avoid bad headers. Even though mr. Raymond points out a lot of other aspects of smart questioning, I believe these four tips will help you a lot in the battle of not becoming a loser.
