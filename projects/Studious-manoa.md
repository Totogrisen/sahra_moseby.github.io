My group made the concept of BookSwap in the class “INFO 262 – Interaction design” at the University of Bergen. It is an application made for students located in Norway, where they easier can thrift required texts. The syllabus fee can be pretty expensive and buying all new isn’t ideal for the student economy. It’s also not eco-friendly to make all students buy new books for all their classes every semester. 

To thrift books isn’t a new concept, but based on a questionnaire with over 100 students, we realized there isn’t any good platforms for this purpose. Our goal was therefor to make an application with a design inspired by social media, which allowed students to sort syllabus based on class code, ISBN number, title, author, etc.. 

We user-tested a high-fidelity prototype on other students to see how they liked it and got great results. The bottom line was clear: the students of Bergen wants our app.

<h3> What i learned </h3>
During this project I learned how to design and user test according to recognized principles and rules within the domain of user experience. It also reassured me that I had chosen the right path of study, because I had a lot of fun working on this project.
