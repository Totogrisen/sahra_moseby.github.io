My group made the concept of BookSwap in the class “INFO 262 – Interaction design” at the University of Bergen. It is an application for made for students in Norway, where they easier can thrift syllabus. The syllabus fee can be pretty expensive and buying all new isn’t ideal for the student economy. It’s also not an eco-friendly solution to make all students buy new books for all their classes every semester. 

To thrift books isn’t a new concept, but based on a questionnaire with over 100 students, we realized there isn’t any good platforms for this purpose. Our goal was therefor to make an application with a design inspired by social media, which allowed students to sort syllabus based on class code, title, author, etc.. 

We user tested a high-fidelity prototype on other students to see how they liked it and got great results. The bottom line was clear: the students of Bergen wants our app.
