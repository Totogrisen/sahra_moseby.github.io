During the fall semester of 2019, I exchanged to the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I took the course Software Engineering 1. The final project in this course was to build a web application dedicated to the UH Manoa community. We were working in teams, using with a tech stack we learned to know the earlier months.

<h3> Our Application </h3>
For our final project, we wanted to look further into the different study spot opportunities campus had to offer. As a new student at UH Manoa, I can confirm that knowing where to study wasn’t easy. We want to provide information about where you can study as a UH Manoa student, and also reveal some hidden pearls around campus. The application would offer the users to add locations and rate them all, so that everyone can find the place best suited for their study habits.

<h3> My Contribution </h3>
I started by making a design mockup of some components in Figma, which is a free online UI tool. Then i started to make the signup, signin and signout pages without any functionality, only focusing on the design. My next task was to add functionality to the different pages. After that I was assigned to fix some design issues.

<h3>In person > slack</h3>
I learned a lot from this course and this project, but it’s especially one thing I want to highlight. We used the issue driven project management strategy to organize out project. The most crucial thing I learned from it is how important in person meetings are. Our biggest struggle was that our time schedules didn’t fit at all. All communication and planning happened in class and on slack, which I believe wasn’t optimal. The reason why I think it wasn’t optimal is because the discussions either had to be short, or you would risk having group members missing out. For example, one Sunday I had over 100 unread messages in Slack, which would be equal to 5 minutes of an in person discussion. So my biggest outcome for future projects is that having regular in person meetings is important, no matter which project, and should be prioritized because it will benefit the entire group.
